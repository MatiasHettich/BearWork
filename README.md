# Repository of BearWork, a Game Maker Studio 2 framework.

This framework was made to make it easier for me to develop future proyects, and is going to be available for free as a GMS2 package (TBA) and GitHub project for anyone who needs it.

## Some features of current version 1.0.2.1 are:
- Scriptable actions for buttons, switches, frames, labels and game items.
- Easy to use GUI elements, with editable sprites and animations.
- Example game structure to learn how things work.
- Original soundtrack used as placeholder music.
- Sound effects and music player.

All aspects of the framework are fully documented and done in GML so if you know what you are doing you can customize it even more!
